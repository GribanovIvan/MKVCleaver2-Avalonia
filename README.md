# MKVCleaver2 on Avalonia. Kinda.

Claude Sonnet 4 rewrite of [MKVCleaver2](https://github.com/StriderAJR/MKVCleaver2) by StriderAJR.

## What

Basically, a program to extract tracks from MKV. I wanted to run it on Linux, so I forced Claude Sonnet 4 to rewrite it to the Avalonia framework that supports Linux.

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0 or later  
- MKVToolnix (`mkvinfo` and `mkvextract`)

## If you want to contribute

Please don't use C#. No good program was ever written in C#, and if it was, then it could have been better.  
I will hide this fork once a sufficient Linux program is released, not excluding the possibility that I will make a proper alternative with a more respectful README.  
If you want to help, the best you can do is start from scratch and do it the right way.

## Status

Works on my machine. Sometimes. Does the job. Maybe.
